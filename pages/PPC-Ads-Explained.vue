    <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
      PPC is short for pay-per-click, a type of digital advertising in which you pay a third party, usually a search engine like Google or Bing, or a social media site like Facebook or LinkedIn, to display your ad.
<br><br>
Paying for digital advertising may seem a little strange at first: after all, most digital content, like email, is free. But when you consider how limited screen real estate is, you quickly see why the market is so competitive.
<br><br>
For example, if you typed the title of this article "What is PPC" into the Google search box, there are over 85 million results for what is PPC. A search engine can only display one page of results at a time, and the limitations of digital devices (and human attention spans) mean it can only display a few pages.

    <h2 class="text-gray-800 text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">History</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">Google sold the idea of displaying ads in search results to other websites early in the internet's history. Businesses could now increase their exposure by bidding against each other to be displayed in relevant keywords. They can do this instead of developing organic links and content to gain spots in the rankings. By placing their ads in search results, businesses are exactly like how advertisers are placed in TV commercials and billboards.

With traditional advertising, businesses pay to rent space on a given publication. This is different from pay-per-click advertising, which allows businesses to only pay fees if individuals click their ads. For instance, an ad could be viewed thousands of times without paying a dime.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-500 text-center sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">Setting up a PPC campaign is pretty simple. You first need to determine your budget and then set your maximum bid price. You also need to create ad groups and determine your keywords and ad text.

Your budget is the amount you're willing to spend on your campaign each day. Your maximum bid price is the highest amount you're willing to pay for a click on your ad. You should set your bid price high enough so that you're always in the top position, but not so high that you're spending more than you want to.
<br><br>
Your ad group is a collection of related keywords and ads. You'll want to create separate ad groups for each of your products or services. This will help you to target your ads more accurately and improve your click-through rate.
<br><br>
Your ad text should be brief and to the point. It should describe what you're selling and why people should buy it. You should also include a call to action, such as "buy
