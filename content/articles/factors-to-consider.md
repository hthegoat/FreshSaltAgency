If you have a board game idea, Kickstarter can be a great way to fund it. But these days, there are more and more board games being funded on the platform. Crowdfunding has been a bit of a gold rush over the last few years, but as more people show up looking to mine that gold, you need to be getting a little smarter in your approach if you want hard currency in your pocket at the end of the campaign. So here are ten ways that you can stand out from the crowdfunding crowd (and I hope this article helps you avoid becoming one of those crowdfunders who talks about how much money they raised and how many backers they got but never actually delivers their product).

## Get involved in the community as you build your own :


One of the most important steps you can take to build buzz for your Kickstarter boardgame is to get involved in the community as you go. If you're new to these forums, then it's time for some education. Check out our beginner's guide on Reddit and Twitter etiquette, then dive in!

Once you've gotten a feel for how things work on social media, consider starting a blog. A blog is a great way to keep people informed about what's happening behind-the-scenes with your game or company—but also (and perhaps more importantly) it gives fans an opportunity to connect with creators like themselves who are excited about the same thing they are: playing games!

Blogs don't just attract buyers; they also attract other creatives who may want to work with or share their own projects with the blog owner. Don't be afraid to ask people questions about their project if it looks interesting; most creators will be happy to answer questions from potential backers if they believe those backers are going through similar struggles!

## Have a playable prototype well in advance of your campaign:

Having a playable prototype is absolutely critical to the success of your campaign. It's not just about getting people excited about the game — it's about proving that it can be made, and what its final form will look like.

Of course, creating a prototype isn't just a matter of slapping together some cardboard pieces and calling it good. You need one people will actually want to play — which means you'll also need art assets (although in-development prototypes don't have to be as pretty as the final product). And remember: this is going to be used for playtesting! That means making sure that all mechanics are working properly, so you'll want someone who understands those mechanics well enough to give feedback on them.

The benefits? Your backers can get excited about the game even before they back it; they'll know exactly what they're backing when they do decide to make their pledges; if there are problems with gameplay or balance issues after reviewing feedback from your community of supporters, you'll have plenty of time before launch day (and hopefully an updated version) so that everyone can get their hands on something enjoyable without worrying whether or not this Kickstarter will fail because something wasn't quite ready yet.

## Prepare a great video:

You're going to want a video that's short, snappy and doesn't drone on. If your video is boring or just plain unfocused, viewers will click away before they can get to the end of it.

It's also important to use high quality video and audio equipment so that what you say is clear and understandable. It would be really embarrassing if someone in your Kickstarter campaign comments section said "I didn't understand what they were doing at any point during their pitch." A tripod will help keep your camera stable while you record footage, which should make things easier on both yourself and the viewers of your campaign.[2]

Make sure there are no noises coming from off-camera (like traffic or kids playing) which could distract people who are listening to what you are saying.[3]

If possible use a good microphone too - preferably one with some kind of noise cancelling technology built into it so that people don't have trouble hearing what is going on with their headphones!

## Have a press kit ready to go:

Have a press kit ready to go

A press kit is a collection of resources that journalists can use to write about you and your game. The more information they have, the easier it is for them to write an article.

Here’s what should be in your kit:

A pitch deck (a brief description of your project and its features)

Images and GIFs that show off the game in action or help explain how it works

A video showing off gameplay (if applicable)

The full text of any press releases or news articles about you and/or your company related to this project (use a document management system like Google Docs or Dropbox if possible so journalists don't have to dig through emails)

The best way to get these materials into journalists' hands is by emailing them individually with a link in their preferred format (PDF, Word document, etc.).

## Contact reviewers and podcasters

Look up your favorite board game reviewers and podcasters, then contact them directly. If they didn't already know about your game, tell them what it's called, where to buy it (if available), and how much it costs. Ask if they would be interested in reviewing or podcasting about the game once it launches its Kickstarter campaign. You can even ask if they'd like to interview you for an article or podcast episode on their website!

## Run Ads With Intent 

Forget about the old days of banner ads. Stopping people in the street and asking them to buy your board game is no longer an effective way to get people engaged with your brand. Instead, use Facebook, Google and Twitter ads to target specific audiences and show them how much fun your board game is. You can even use Instagram if you like!

You'll want a Facebook ad manager account for this. It's free for anyone who wants one (and it's easy!). Just make sure that you're following all Facebook rules so that you don't get banned from advertising on their site (no nudity or illegal content).


## Build A (Quality) Email List 

Once you have launched your board game on Kickstarter, you need to start building an email list. Why? Because email marketing is one of the most effective ways to reach out to people and get them interested in your product. It’s also one of the most inexpensive ways to market your product as well!

So how do you build an email list? There are several ways, but the easiest way is through social media and networking. Start by signing up for Twitter or Facebook accounts for yourself so that others can connect with you there easily (don’t worry about setting up a page yet). Then tweet about what projects you're working on with links back towards your Kickstarter page! You can also use hashtags like #kickstarter or #boardgames when tweeting about these things because people searching those terms will find it easier when looking through all their options instead just seeing everything from everyone else on Twitter who might not be relevant right now anyway."

## Use Your Network 

If you have a network of friends and family, use them to promote your Kickstarter campaign. When people ask what you're up to, tell them about your campaign! You never know who might be interested in helping out with the project.

## Groups, Groups, Groups

One of the best ways to get the word out about your game is through social media. Social media gives you a chance to connect in a meaningful way with your audience, and it's also a great way to get feedback on what people like about your game and what they don't like about it.

You'll want to target a variety of different groups—board gamers, tabletop enthusiasts, casual players and more—and use multiple platforms so that you can reach as many people as possible. Consider posting on Facebook, Twitter/Instagram and Reddit (for example).

## Conclusion

There is no easy way to get a successful Kickstarter Boardgame. It takes time, effort, planning and most of all a great game that you can stand behind in order to bring a project this far. We hope these ten marketing tips were helpful as you plan your campaign, or as you continue to market your game once it has been published.
